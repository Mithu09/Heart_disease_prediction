Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on their medical data. By analyzing various health-related features, the model can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and prioritize patients for further examination.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Heart Disease UCI dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains various attributes related to a patient's health and a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. You can download the dataset from the provided link or use the data included in this repository in the 'data' folder.

Installation
To run this project locally, you'll need to have Python installed. We recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Navigate to the project directory:

cd heart-disease-prediction
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the machine learning models:

jupyter notebook HeartDiseasePrediction.ipynb
or

python HeartDiseasePrediction.py
Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook or script to perform predictions on new data or evaluate the models' performance.

Models
This project employs several machine learning models, including but not limited to:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Neural Network (Deep Learning)
These models are used to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on the dataset's features. You can explore and experiment with different models in the Jupyter Notebook or script.

Evaluation
The performance of the machine learning models is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation results are presented in the Jupyter Notebook or script, allowing you to assess the model's effectiveness.
